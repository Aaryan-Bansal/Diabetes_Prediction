Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems. In the context of predicting diabetes, logistic regression can help determine the probability that an individual has diabetes based on various input features (such as age, BMI, blood pressure, etc.).

Understanding Logistic Regression
Purpose: Logistic regression is used to model the probability of a binary outcome. In the case of diabetes prediction, the outcome is binary: either the person has diabetes (1) or they do not (0).

Sigmoid Function: It uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to map predicted values to probabilities between 0 and 1.

Using the test-train split is a standard approach to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. Here’s a quick rundown of how you can interpret the results from the accuracy score and confusion matrix:

1. Accuracy Score
Definition: The accuracy score measures the proportion of correctly classified instances (both true positives and true negatives) out of the total number of instances.

Interpretation: A higher accuracy indicates better model performance. However, accuracy alone might not be sufficient, especially if the data is imbalanced (i.e., one class is much more frequent than the other).


2. Confusion Matrix
Definition: The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model’s performance by showing the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).
